          <ol>
            <il>Deliberate</il>
            <p> Deliberate occupations are planned and have an advance party preceding a platoon to conduct extensive preparation of a new position. A deliberate occupation may take place during daylight hours following a daylight operation, at night after a daylight preparation, or at night following a nighttime preparation. Only the minimum number of vehicles and personnel go forward. Excessive activity during preparation risks compromise. When a tactical situation allows, a good procedure for deliberate occupations of a new position is to do the preparation before darkness and to move the sections by night. Deliberate nighttime occupation following a nighttime preparation is often necessary, but it can be time-consuming. A guide meets a platoon at a pickup point and leads the vehicle to the entrance of the position area. There, the vehicle guides wait to lead the vehicles to selected locations.
              A platoon sergeant implements the security and defense plan as personnel become available. When the mortar platoon occupies a position that has a limited field of vision, each squad establishes OPs with a means of communication. When the position or mission allows the entire platoon to occupy one location,  4 gun provides an OP as early warning. The responsibility for which gun covers each OP is established in the TACSOP. A method is to have each flank gun (one and four) cover the flanks while the two and three guns cover the front and back. This is an example, as METT-TC and manning are the major considerations. Considerations for night occupations are as follows: Light discipline must be practiced. Proper preparation for a night occupation minimizes the need for lights. Noise discipline is most important, since noise can be heard at much greater distances at night. The time for occupation is increased. Each vehicle guide knows the location of each vehicle in the order of march allowing the platoon to move smoothly into position without halting the column. Vehicles do not move within the position without a guide.</p>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <il>Hasty</il>
            <p>Hasty occupations are also planned. They differ from deliberate occupations in preparation time for the advance party. A hasty occupation may be necessary due to rapid combat operations or unforeseen circumstances. An advance or reconnaissance party may be able to accomplish site preparation, such as marking firing positions, manning the release point, and establishing security. Once the platoon has arrived at the location to be occupied, it may require more time to complete the occupation than during a deliberate occupation. This is because some preparatory tasks that are performed during a deliberate occupation cannot be completed during the limited time available for the reconnaissance and selection phase of a hasty occupation. However, platform-mounted MFCS greatly increases the process of occupying a firing position and having the gun(s) ready to fire.</p>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <ol>
            <il>Emergency</il>
            <p>Emergency occupations result when a call for fire is received while a platoon is making a tactical movement. They require a mortar platoon or section to occupy the first available location without any prior site preparation</p>

          <ol>
              <li>Observation and Fields of Fire</li>
              <p>The evaluation of observation and fields of fire allows you to-

                Identify potential engagement areas
                Identify defensible terrain and weapons system positions.
                Identify where maneuvering forces are most vulnerable to observation and fires.
                <br>
                Observation is the ability to see over a particular area to acquire targets.
                
                “Visibility” is weather dependent or is a temporary phenomena. Observation, on the other hand, is terrain dependent and is relatively permanent. Generally, the best observation is obtained from the highest terrain in an area.
                <br>
                Fields of Fire
                
                The area a weapon can cover effectively from a given point
                Fires can be of two basic types
                
                Direct fire weapons like machine guns, rifles, and TOW weapon systems which require direct line of sight to their targets.
                Indirect fire weapons such as mortars and artillery
                Observation and fields of fire are not the same. You may be able to see 25 km, but if all you see are armed with a rifle, then your fields of fire will probably be limited to something like 500 meters.</p> <br>
              <li>Cover and Concealmen</li>
              <p> <h3>Cover</h3>

                The protection from the effects of weapons fires, direct, indirect, and air to ground.
                
                Certain aspects of the terrain may provide good cover from some fires, while some may provide cover from only one of these types.
                
                <h3>Concealment</h3>
                
                Protection from observation, either from the air or from the ground or both.
                
                Examples:
                
                slope
                vegetation
                built up areas
                
                Remember that cover can be used to protect a force from the effects of direct and indirect fires. Also it can, in some cases, be used to protect a force from observation. If this is the case, then the object providing cover is also providing concealment. But cover and concealment do not always equate.
                
                If an attacking force can move forward under concealment, the chances of achieving surprise increase. Concealed and covered approach routes are important to reconnaissance units, dismounted infantry, and insurgent or terrorist forces.
                
                Defending forces seek to defend in an area which offers both concealment and cover to themselves but which does not provide covered approaches for the threat</p> <br>
              <li>Obstacles (man made and natural)</li>
              <p>Any natural or manmade terrain feature that stops, impedes, slows, or diverts movement.

                Examples:
                
                buildings, steep slopes, rivers, lakes, forests, deserts, swamps, jungles, cities, minefield, trenches, andmilitary wire obstacles
                
                Things to look for:
                
                Vegetation (tree spacing and trunk diameter).
                Surface drainage (stream width, depth, velocity, bank slope, and height).
                Surface materials (soil types and conditions that affect mobility).
                Surface configuration (slopes that affect mobility).
                Obstacles (natural and manmade; consider obstacles to flight as well as ground mobility).
                Transportation systems (bridge classifications and road characteristics such as curve,radius, slopes, and width)
                Effects of actual or projected weather such as heavy precipitation or snow over.</p> <br>
              <li>Key or Decisive Terrain</li>
              <p>Some terrain feature (natural or manmade) which, if controlled, will give a marked advantage to whoever controls it.
                Often selected for use as battle positions or objectives
                Echelon of command, mission, enemy, and situation dependent.
                To designate terrain as decisive is to recognize that the mission depends on seizing or retaining it.
                Key or decisive terrain must be controlled, not necessarily occupied. It may be controlled by either fires or maneuver.
                
                Examples:
                
                a bridge over an unfordable river which gives access to the opposite shore without requiring an assault crossing.
                a level clearing in rough terrain which is the only accessible landing field for airmobile operations
                if you identify only one valid avenue of approach to the command’s objective, then the choke points on that avenue will probably become key terrain (compared to a situation where several AAs are available).</p> <br>
              <li>Avenues of Approachs</li>
              <p>An AoA is an air or ground route of an attacking force of a given size leading to its objective or to key terrain in its path.</p>
